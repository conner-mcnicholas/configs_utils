# configs_utils
Shell settings and plugins for a most prodigious terminal IDE.
Tailored for developing in q,k,python,sql,git,bash.  
Includes bells+whistles such as: 
  linting
  code completion
  syntax highlighting
  hyperlinks to manuals

  ...and MUCH MUCH MORE!  

Because github beats looking for scripts "in that place where I put that thing that time"
